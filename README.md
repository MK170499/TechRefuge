TOMATO PLANT DISEASE DETECTION AND CLASSIFICATION

OVERVIEW
This project aims to detect and classify diseases in tomato plants using a machine learning model based on MobileNetV2 architecture. It is designed to be lightweight and suitable for deployment on devices with limited processing capabilities, such as Raspberry Pi 3B.

FEATURES
Utilizes MobileNetV2 architecture for efficient inference on resource-constrained devices.
Capable of classifying various diseases affecting tomato plants.
Suitable for deployment on Raspberry Pi 3B for real-time disease detection in agricultural settings.
Provides an efficient solution for early disease detection, allowing for timely intervention and improved crop management.

USAGE
Training the Model: Train the machine learning model using labeled datasets of healthy and diseased tomato plants.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model on Raspberry Pi 3B or similar devices for real-time disease detection in tomato plants.
Inference: Utilize the deployed model to classify diseases in tomato plants based on input images captured from agricultural fields.
